# task is to create an AI engine that can predict and alert about cost anomalies as well as performance anomalies (such as unforeseen downtimes) based on all metrics. Additionally, the AI engine should be capable of automatically adjusting cloud resources to prevent such events.

if we have access to realistic data, then we can use api key for the data and directly use the data set,

now, we have made own small dataset,
where we have found imporant matrices are - timestamp, cpu_uses, memory_uses, disk_input_output, Network in - Network out, cost etc.

now we will integrating this dataset in our code and then the code will threw alert when anomalies are detected and adjust cloud resources to to prevent predicted anomalies, thereby maintaining performance and cost-efficiency...

Thank You
